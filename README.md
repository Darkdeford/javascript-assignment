## Topic: Basics for functional programming in javascript

Here are 10 practical exercises in javascript.

Fork repository and publish solution as your public repository, so we can check it online.
If it is ready in your repo, pls. an send me email on kajo@mewe.com and we will check it.

If this is not convenient for you, send it to me by email as one zipped file.

Use lodash library and some functional aspects of javascript, eg:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter
https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind

Preferably:

* Do not use stackoverflow or similar sites.
* Do not use loops (each, for, while etc.).
* Most of excercises will be run by node if not stated differently. You need to run 'npm install lodash' for most to make them working.
